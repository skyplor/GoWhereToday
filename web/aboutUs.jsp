                    Go Where Today is the masterpiece of six highly motivated members from jCube.
                    The team's mission is to promote the awareness of lesser-known venues in Singapore.
                    The team envisions to create a comprehensive and informative website for natives and tourists in Singapore to seek out the interesting and exotic.

                    The logo design depicts what Go Where Today entails.
                    The vibrant orange word hidden between the other two is like the gem; the activity/food place that not many are aware of but yet holds something unique and extraordinary.
